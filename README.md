# NPI ContactDomain FOIA Data

This is a list of NPIs connected to contact email domains as submitted by providers to NPPES. For example, when Jane Smith applied for an NPI, she provided a contact email of "jane.smith@examplehospital.com". In the data, her NPI will be listed alongside the domain of "examplehospital.com".

This data comes from the NPPES database, but is NOT currently included in the public dissemination file provided by CMS. 

203,939 rows of data are in this release. We expect to refresh FOIA requests in the future, and we expect the number of records to increase over time.

# NPI ContactDomain FOIA Data

This is a list of NPIs connected to contact email domains as submitted by providers to NPPES. For example, when Jane Smith applied for an NPI, she provided a contact email of "jane.smith@examplehospital.com". In the data, her NPI will be listed alongside the domain of "examplehospital.com".

This data comes from the NPPES database, but is not currently included in the public dissemination file (https://download.cms.gov/nppes/NPI_Files.html). 

203,939 rows of data are in this release. We will be making refresh FOIA requests in the future, and and we expect the number of records to increase substantially over time. As we receive more data, we will release it.
